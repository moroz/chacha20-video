The test suite uses CUnit. On macOS, you can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```shell
brew install cunit
```

On Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, WSL2):

```shell
sudo apt install -y libcunit1 libcunit1-doc libcunit1-dev
```

Then you can run tests using:

```shell
make test
```
